# Game AI Modules
Simple text based samples that I use to teach myself concept of AI in games.
Currently, I have covered the following topics:

**1. State Machines** - Finite State Machine used to implement a rudimentary text-based 'choose your own adventure'.  
(Also added functionality to load a level layout dynamically via an XML file)

**2. Behavior Trees** - Simple scenarios to understand the relationship with Selector/Sequence nodes.
Final example also includes the use of few decorated nodes to quickly craft more complex scenarios.
